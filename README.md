# Insurance Quote Engine

## Overview

This cloud-based insurance quote engine gathers user information to provide tailored insurance quotes.  Designed with a microservices architecture, it ensures scalability, maintainability, and fault tolerance.  The system places a strong emphasis on the security of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and adheres to GDPR regulations.

## Key Features

* **Quote Generation:** Users input their details to receive customized insurance quotes.
* **Microservices Architecture:**
    * **API Gateway:** Central point for handling user requests, routing them efficiently to the appropriate backend services.  It also manages authentication, authorization, and security.
    * **Quote Service:** Orchestrates the quote generation process, coordinating with other services to gather data and calculate premiums.
    * **Pricing Engine:** Calculates insurance premiums based on user-provided data and defined business rules.
    * **Database:** Stores persistent data, including user information, quote details, and product catalogs.
    * **Real-time Event Component (Optional):** Enables real-time quote updates and supports dynamic pricing adjustments.
    * **Notification Service (Optional):** Provides users with timely updates and notifications regarding their quotes.
* **Security:** The system incorporates robust security measures to protect sensitive data:
    * PII Protection: Encryption (at rest and in transit) safeguards user data.
    * Access Control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) ensures that only authorized users can access specific data.
    * Data Loss Prevention (DLP):  DLP mechanisms prevent unauthorized data leakage.
    * Data Handling: Masking and tokenization are employed to protect sensitive information.
    * Attack Prevention: Input validation and sanitization neutralize potential attacks.
    * Logging and Auditing:  Comprehensive logging and auditing provide a detailed record of system activity.
    * Vulnerability Management:  Regular assessments and proactive patch management minimize vulnerabilities.
    * Privacy by Design:  Privacy considerations are integrated into the system's core design.
    * Incident Response:  A well-defined plan is in place to address security incidents.
    * GDPR Compliance:  The system adheres to GDPR principles, including support for data subject rights.
* **Real-time Capabilities (Optional):** The system can be configured to deliver real-time quote updates as users modify their input, enhancing the user experience.
* **Scalability:** The microservices architecture enables horizontal scaling to handle increased demand.
* **Maintainability:** The modular design simplifies maintenance and future updates.
* **Testability:** The system is designed to facilitate thorough testing.
* **Monitoring:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging provide insights into system performance.
